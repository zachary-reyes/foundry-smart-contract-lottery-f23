# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket.
    The ticket fees are going to the winner during the draw.

2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner.
    And this will be done programatically.

3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation.
    Chainlink VRF -> Randomness.
    Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger.
